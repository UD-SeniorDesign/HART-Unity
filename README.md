The goal of this project is to take in radar data from an external server and use the HoloLens to visualize this data. 
The visualization will use the Mapbox SDK to get geospatial information to provide geographic points of intrest that may not be be visible from a simple map view. 

You will need to install the Unity-HoloLens SDK and the Mapbox SDK for this project to work.

Warning, this is just the raw code uploaded to github, it still needs some management and there may be issues with directly importing it into Unity. Email Vinay Vazir at vvazir@udel.edu if you are using this code and have any issues
